# NoteSwap 📚 - Share, Swap, Succeed. 🚀

## Inspiration ✨

The idea for NoteSwap was born out of our recognition of the common challenge faced by students and learners when it comes to sharing and finding educational notes and materials. As students ourselves, we often struggled to access high-quality study materials for various subjects. We realized the need for a platform that simplifies the process of sharing and discovering educational notes and resources. This realization served as the driving force behind the development of NoteSwap.

## What it does 🚀

NoteSwap is an educational platform that empowers both students and educators to easily share and search for study materials, lecture notes, and educational resources. With NoteSwap, users can effortlessly upload their study materials and access a wide range of educational content contributed by the community. Whether you're a student in search of notes on a specific topic or an educator eager to share your knowledge, NoteSwap streamlines the entire process, making educational resources more accessible to everyone. NoteSwap currently supports text-based study materials.

## How we built it 🔧

NoteSwap was constructed using a modern tech stack, including:

- React: We leveraged React as the frontend framework to craft a dynamic and responsive user interface.
